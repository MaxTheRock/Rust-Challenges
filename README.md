# Algorithm Challenge Booklet

## 40 Algorithm Challenges

This booklet has been created to help learners become familiar with creating flowcharts and pseudocode.

Reference may be made to the pseudocode guide at the back of the GCSE (9-1) Computer Science specification when creating pseudocode answers, or learners may wish to develop their own style of pseudocode for use within the challenges.

It should be noted that there may be **different ways** to solve each challenge. Credit should be given for a solution where it meets the requirements and is technically correct. There is no requirement to write the pseudocode in any particular style. You may wish to limit credit where you feel a learner does not create a fully efficient solution.

Whilst the challenges are graded from 1 to 10 in difficulty, these are approximate and are suggested only. The grading in difficulty does not necessarily reflect the GCSE 9-1 grading systems.

A list of relevant techniques that learners may need to understand to solve these challenges may be found in the current GCSE (9-1) Computer Science specification. This is available to download from the [J276 Computer Science webpage](http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-computer-science-j276-from-2016/).

## Challenges

---
## Difficulty 1  ✅
---
### Challenge 1  ✅
Design a program which asks the user to **input** their name, age, and favourite colour.

---

### Challenge 2  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** their first name. The program then **outputs** the user's first name.

---

### Challenge 3  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** their surname and then their first name. The program then **outputs** the user’s first name and surname **separately**.

---

### Challenge 4  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** their first name and then their surname. The program then **outputs** the user’s first name and surname **on the same line**.

---
## Difficulty 2  ✅
---

### Challenge 5  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** two numbers. The program adds them together and then **outputs** the total.

---

### Challenge 6  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** two numbers. The program will then **output**:
- The two numbers added together.
- The two numbers multiplied together.

---

### Challenge 7  ✅
**Tip:** Speed = Distance / Time  
Write an algorithm that:
- Asks the user for the distance (in metres).

- Calculates and outputs the average speed using a function.

---
## Difficulty 3  ✅
---

### Challenge 8  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** how many minutes and texts they have used in the last month and then **outputs** the total cost of the bill. This is calculated by:
- The total cost of the minutes (at £0.10 per minute).
- Adding this to the total cost of the texts (at £0.05 per text).
- Adding on an additional monthly charge of £10.00.

---
## Difficulty 4
---

### Challenge 9  ✅
Write an algorithm that:
- Stores a random first name as a variable.
- Asks the user to input their first name.
- If it is the same as the stored name, outputs "You’re cool."
- Otherwise, outputs "Nice to meet you."

---

### Challenge 10  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** the number of letters in the alphabet. The program must then **output** whether they got it correct or incorrect.

---

### Challenge 11  ✅
The program asks the user to **input** two numbers. It will then **output** the larger of these two numbers.

---

### Challenge 12  ✅
Write an algorithm that:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 10.
- Asks the user to guess this number.
- If they guess it correctly, it should display "Correct."
- Otherwise, display "Not what I was thinking."

---

### Challenge 13  ✅
A company calculates holiday allowance for employees.  
The company gives each employee 28 days of holiday each year. Holidays are awarded based on the following rules:
1. Full-time employees who work 5 days a week get 28 days of holiday a year.
2. Part-time employees get a proportion of holiday allowance based on how many days they work (e.g., an employee who works 1 day a week would only get 1/5th of the holidays allowed).

---
## Difficulty 5  ✅
---

### Challenge 14  ✅
Write an algorithm that:
- Asks the user to input the traffic light colour.
- If the traffic light colour is green, outputs "Go."
- If the traffic light colour is amber, outputs "Get Ready."
- Otherwise, outputs "Stop."

---

### Challenge 15  ✅
Write a program that:
- Asks the user to name one of the Olympic Values (Respect, Excellence, and Friendship).
- If they correctly name one, output "That’s correct."
- Otherwise, outputs "Incorrect."

---

### Challenge 16  ✅

- Asks the user how long on average they spend watching TV each day.
- If it is less than 2 hours, outputs "That should be ok."
- If it is between 2 and 4 hours, outputs "That will rot your brain."
- Otherwise, outputs "That is too much TV."

---
